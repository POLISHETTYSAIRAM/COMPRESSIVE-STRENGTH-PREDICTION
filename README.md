# COMPRESSIVE-STRENGTH-PREDICTION
Random Forest algorithm and Firefly algorithm are hybridized for the prediction of Compressive Strength of Concrete
The benefit of hybridizing with Firefly algorithm is to reduce the computational time while hyper-parameter tuning the Random Forest algorithm
The hyper-parameters tuned here are Number of Trees and Number of Leaves per Tree in the random forest algorithm
It is also calculated that the time taken for hyper-parmeter tuning using the GridSearchCV and to obtain the optimum values using Firefly algorithm
